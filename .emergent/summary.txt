The AI engineer successfully built an MVP for G.M.B Travels Kashmir, progressing from a basic static landing page to a sophisticated full-stack application. Initially, a frontend-only design with mock data was created, showcasing key sections and a contact form. Subsequent iterations involved implementing a robust backend with MongoDB, user authentication, and an extensive admin panel. Key features developed include tour package management, image management, client booking views, and a multi-role team management system. A significant achievement was the custom PDF generation system, replicating the user's specific format for tour packages, including download and email functionalities. The conversation concluded with the user requesting further CRM enhancements, AI-powered blog management, and a comprehensive website content management system. The AI engineer is currently addressing these advanced features, having already initiated the CRM component and planning the content management system.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating the advanced CRM features and the AI Blog Management system, following the user's explicit instructions.

Specifically:
1.  **GPT-5 Integration Blueprint**: The AI engineer had just obtained an integration blueprint for GPT-5, likely for the upcoming AI Blog Management system (Chat Message 97).
2.  **CRM Frontend Development**: The AI engineer created  (Chat Message 98). This file is intended to provide the frontend interface for managing client profiles as part of the Client Management System under Phase 3.
3.  **Website Content Management System**: The user then requested to add a team login in footer (which the AI internally noted was already present in the main website footer) and, more significantly, Let admin update all details in website , contacts , email, insert map, and other changes create that control (Chat Message 99).
4.  **Planning Site Control Panel**: The AI engineer acknowledged this request as a comprehensive Website Content Management System and planned to create a complete site control panel (Chat Message 100). This indicates the immediate next focus is on designing and implementing this content management interface in the admin panel.

The current state of the product includes a fully functional frontend with mock data, a robust backend with authentication, package management, team management, and a PDF generation system. The CRM system is in its initial stages with the  page created, and the AI Blog Management and Website Content Management systems are next in line.
